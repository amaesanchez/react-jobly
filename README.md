### To run the app in development mode:
`npm i`  
`npm start`  
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.

This project was created during a sprint -- due to time constraints, I was not able to implement tests. I do plan to add tests in the near future!

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
