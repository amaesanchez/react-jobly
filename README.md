# Getting Started with react-jobly

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.

### Testing

This project was created during a spring -- due to time constraints, I was not able to implement tests. I do plan to add tests in the near future!

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
