# Getting Started with Jobly

Deployed on: asanchez-jobly.surge.sh

### To run the app in development mode:

`npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.

This project was created during a spring -- due to time constraints, I was not able to implement tests. I do plan to add tests in the near future!

`npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
